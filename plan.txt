to draft moves:

1. save draft
    a. save in player data in game
        i. don't send to other players
    b. it might look something like this: [{"letter": "B", "bankIndex": 2, "pos": [7, 7]}, {"letter": "A", "bankIndex": 5, "pos": [7, 8]}]
        i. "letter" is stored only for redundancy. No function requires it,
           but if it is present and does not match the bank index, the validity
           check will fail.
    c. only store it if all letters are connected
        i. don't worry if words are invalid
2. load draft
    a. send it with the game data
    b. if another player makes a conflicting move, the draft will be removed
    c. draft will be "server rendered"
        i. validity will be checked on the server before sending the draft to the client
        ii. this will allow an easier front-end implementation, as well as a way to clear the draft if it is not valid
3. delete draft
    a. when the user double-clicks
    b. when they otherwise remove all letters from the board
    c. when they make a move
